# QRCodeApp
The repo for my Facharbeit
A Facharbeit (I think term paper in English) is like a preparation for science papers in uni.
It's a task from my high school (Gymnasium in Germany).
The program is supposed to generate QR-Code with Byte Mode, M error Correction and Masking pattern 1.

At this point, the program can generate a readable version 1 QR-Code; every higher version can't be read and from version 4 the program crashes.
